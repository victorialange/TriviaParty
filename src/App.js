// UPDATED PSEUDO CODE
// Get data (questions, incorrectAnswers, correctAnswer, category, difficulty) from the Trivia API and put that data into stateful variables
// use async await function to call the async function that makes the API call only when the user submits the dropdown form/start button (inside submitHandler)
// depending on the user's selection from the dropdown, create different async functions in order to make API calls at different endpoints (based on given URLSearch params, when category is specified in the endpoint, API only provides data for questions that match that filter, and vice versa for difficulty)
// since for the dropdown menu, I have to control the input anyway with stateful variables that hold the values of the user inputs, I can just use those as the values for the categories and difficulty params inside the URLSearch params (when setting up the API call)
// then in order to make sure that no question repeats itself after another, use a while loop and an if statement in order to skip over the same question ids that are contained in the question ids array asked (let variable defined above App function, constantly changes) - break the while loop once the current question id is not included in the asked array, then push the current question id into the array, so that the new id gets stored in there too (prevents further repetition).
// set other states that help define conditions whether certain elements get rendered onto the page or not and what classNames are assigned to those elements (if form was submitted, what kind of text/intro is being displayed, colour changes etc)
// update those stateful variables inside the event listener functions, so submitHandler, clickHandler that gets passed into the otherClickHandler inside the DisplayForm button for the new question button, and the userCategory and userLevel states (inside the changeHandlers give those a value of e.target.value, for submitHandler set the submitted state to true, and the initialIntro to next), also define variables for the text and store those into state (for initialIntro the string value of the intro variable is the default value, gets updated accordingly when the user submits/starts the game)
// define the otherClickHandler function in the DisplayForm component and pass in the clickHandler function from App.js as a prop. Also define other necessary states in that component and update the values of those accordingly inside the functions and under certain conditions (if statements) (submitHandler for quiz, then the leaveClick handler where the userInput and other states get cleared, set back to their default value, also defined the leave handler inside the App.js to then use as a prop in the displayForm component)
// use the state values in the return of the displayForm (JSX) as props to display those values onto the page
// map through the newly created randomized allAnswers array, so that user doesn't know where the correct answer is being displayed (created in the async function in App.js, used concat to inser correctAnswer into incorrectAnswers array, returned a new answers array, then used math.random to then store into another array. that array then gets stored into the allAnswers state). wrap the answers in a div that holds the input and the label, so that they're all aligned well (and also to apply styling to the whole container rather than just each individual item)
// only display the displayForm component onto the page if the user submitted the dropdown form
// then add additional elements to display onto the page when the quiz data is shown, so when the user is currently playing (an option to return back to the initial display and choose different categories and levels/restart the game, also further instructions based on whether the user submitted an answer or not, customize the messages based on whether the user submitted AND got the answer either right or wrong, also change background colour accordingly (green for right, red for wrong))
// optional: added in custom messages as an array, one for when the user submitted correct answers, and the other one when he submitted incorrect answers
// then randomized the order of those arrays (with the index numbers), so that user would get a different custom message randomly
// also added in counter for each question that gets submitted and answered correctly and then one for each time the user has submitted an answer regardless whether correct or incorrect, store those into state, update those in the submit handler and empty them out in the leave handler
// for that it's important to clear the state's values, or set them back to their default values
// also changed: chose to limit the amount of times a user can get different questions per round (if the array of question ids asked is greater than 10) , mostly to avoid 429 error of making too many API calls in a small timeframe, also reasonable to set it 10 questions per round since the user can always go back and play again





// original PSEUDO CODE

// Get data (questions, category, incorrectAnswers, correctAnswer) from the Trivia API when App.js mounts
// Use (import) Axios to make the API call
// Only make the API call once when the App.js mounts, so for that use useEffect with an empty dependency array (import useEffect).

// Have a button on the page that lets user start the trivia question. On pressing the button (click), start displaying question and answer possibilities (label and checkbox, can only check one). Also have a return to start or get a different question button, in case the user doesn't like this question (for this also an event listener onClick that lets user return to start display, when clicked)

// Add an event listener function clickHandler to only display the data from the API, when the user has clicked the button.

// Use map to return new array with the data and render it onto the page. For that use useState (import useState), which will trigger a re-render to the page and allows me to return new JSX with the questions and choices on the page.

// Display the questions and answers from the API in its own component(DisplayQuestions) and import the component into App.js. Use props inside the component to pass down functions from App.js. In there write JSX to display the questions and answer choices, plus a sumbit button and another restart button. Also include an if statement, that returns either a "GOOD JOB!" or a "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!" statement based on whether the user chose the right or wrong anwer (userChoice == correctAnswer, or userChoice !== incorrectAnswers) and a button that lets user start a new game with a different question (anotherOnClick) (all inside another event listener function upon form submission - submitHandler).

// inside the onSubmitHandler make submit button from quiz and the restart disappear, and based on the if statement (which conditions apply), display either right or wrong statement and the option to start a new game (newGameClickHandler).

// whole quiz == form
// question == label
// possible answers == inputs with type=checkbox
// buttons (return and submit answer)
// submit answer button with type=submit

// originally:
// lose start button (stretch goal)
// maybe no useEffect, put it in state to have it show up every time user submits/clicks (eventHandler func)
// functionality to check with array ids in state to avoid showing same question

// inputs changed to type=radio to limit user to only one choice (checkbox better for more possible answers, here only one answer)
